## Author's Note

I am sure there was a good reason on behalf of the recruiters to require vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this assessment. While it was easy and simple, I could not help being reminded of how much more efficient a JavaScript framework such as React is when it comes to creating reactive and reusable elements. Additionally, with the advent of Tailwind CSS and even a few modern additions to vanilla CSS, Sass is starting to feel dated and redundant.
